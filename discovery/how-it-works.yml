  description: >
    Our service processes information from a wide number of authoritative
    scholarly data sources to discover, download and validate information about
    free availability of articles wherever they are located on the web. In this
    way, we are curating a vast database of freely available copies of articles.
    CORE Discovery has a preference for displaying first the open access
    content, originating from our approved content providers, and seeks
    alternative routes, providing access to free versions, only if they are not
    available from them.
