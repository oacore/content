        Our tests have shown that CORE Discovery delivers state-of-the-art
        performance compared to other discovery tools in terms of both content
        coverage (finding a freely available copy when it is available) and
        precision (reliably delivering a free copy of the paper on success).

      description: |
        CORE Discovery is the only free content discovery extension developed
        by researchers for researchers. There is no major publisher
        or enterprise controlling and profiting from your usage data.

    - title: Best grip on open repository content.
      description: |
        Due to CORE being a leader in indexing open access literature,
        CORE Discovery has the best grip on open content from open repositories
        as opposed to other services that disproportionately focus only
        on content indexed in major commercial databases.

      description: |
        The only service offering seamless and free integration
        into repositories. CORE Discovery is also the only discovery system
        that can locate scientific content even for items with
        an unknown DOI or which do not have a DOI.
