    title: 1. Significant changes in REF2029 Open Access Policy from 1st January 2026
    content: |
      It is important to note that for all in-scope outputs submitted to **REF 2029**
      published between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2025, the open
      access policy requirements for **REF 2021** still apply.
      
      The revised policy requirements for **REF2029** came into force for all
      journal articles and conference contributions on 1st January 2026.
      
      The **REF2029 Guidance** makes a clear distinction between 'Published Open Access' (aka Gold, Diamond, Platinum) and 'Outputs shared by Deposit' (Green OA)
      
      **Published Open Access**
      
      For Published Open Access, where an output is made fully open access on publication (commonly termed 'Gold' open access, also 'Diamond' or 'Platinum'), conditional
      to it also fully meeting discovery, access and licensing criteria there is no further action required.
      
      **Outputs shared by Deposit**
      
      From 3.3.2: Deposit: outputs subject to a post-publication embargo which are shared through institutional repositories ("Green" open access) are required to be deposited
      on publication rather than on acceptance for publication, which was the case in **REF 2021**.
      
      However, 7.2.3 then says: "Outputs shared by deposit: Where an output will be compliant via deposit in a suitable repository or other appropriate platform, a copy of such
      output should be deposited within three months of publication. This includes outputs subject to an allowable embargo requirement"
      
      This therefore indicates that **ALL** Green OA outputs must be deposited within 3 months of publication, not acceptance as was the case for **REF2021**.
      
      **Changes in allowed embargo periods**
      
      There has been a significant reduction in the allowed embargo periods for REF2029:

      **Changes in Licensing requirements**
        
        Currently, the funding bodies do not mandate any specific licence format or standard and recognise that researchers and institutions may choose from a variety of
        formats suitable for their output subject to meeting minimum standards identified. The current **REF2029** guidance states;
        
        "Outputs should be shared as openly as possible; the funding bodies' strong preference is for licensing as **CC-BY** or other licence formats meeting this standard of openness.
        However, licensing outputs at **CC-BY-NC** or **CC-BY-ND** (including **CC-BY-NC-ND**) or licences meeting an equivalent standard of openness are also permitted."
        
        For the period 1 January 2026 to 31 December 2028 outputs shared by deposit (AAM), where subject to terms of a publication agreement limiting sharing and/or use of
        downloaded materials (embargo period) will not need to fully meet these licensing standards. They will however need to meet all other conditions for deposit, discovery
        and access.
        
        However, from 1 January 2029 all future in-scope outputs will need to fully meet open licensing standards, subject to any permissible exceptions.
        
        Having the correct licences clearly described in the metadata for your outputs is already an important step in making sure your content is as widely distributed and used
        as possible, from 2029 this will be an additional requirement to ensure compliance with **REF** policy.
    subContent: |
      "Journal articles and conference contributions (with an International Standard Serial
      Number (ISSN) published between 1st January 2026 and 31st December 2028 are
      in-scope outputs for **REF2029** and will be subject to the revised open access policy
      requirements for submission for **REF** in effect from 1st January 2026."

    title: 2. REF2029 Audit – Guidance
    content: |
      The final guidance for how the Open Access audit will be undertaken has not yet been publicly released. The current official statement is as follows:
      
      "The full audit guidance for **REF 2029** is being developed. For open access, audit processes will broadly mirror the risk-based approach for **REF 2021**, subject to further review
      and potential adjustments."
      
      The previous guidance is accessible via the **REF website**, however the relevant sections from it are given below:
    subContent: |
      **46.** We will assess each HEIs' overall compliance with the **REF 2021** open access policy by …. : iv. Using
      **CORE**, comparing the datePublished and depositedDate and identifying where the number of days
      between the two dates is greater than 92.

      **49.** Where there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate a robust and well-managed process for open
      access, we will identify a set of outputs from each submission made by the HEI, and request further
      information to verify whether they are compliant with the policy, or whether an exception applies. Outputs
      may be selected randomly, or based on information in **unpaywall.org** or **CORE**, or a combination of
      the two. We will select outputs that have been returned as compliant with the policy, and/or outputs that have
      been returned with exceptions.
    content2: |
      Consequently, at this time we are advising UK HEIs and **CORE** members to follow previous guidelines and the recommendations given below.

      We are currently engaging in dialogue with the **REF Team** and **Research England** so we can continually keep you up to date with any and all changes to the published
      guidelines and how they may affect your institution.
  - id: recommendations
    title: 3. Recommendations for exposing research outputs' metadata to CORE for REF2029
    content: |
      The following points are recommendations we make to institutional repositories to ensure their data is well represented in **CORE**. While these recommendations are not
      mandated by **Research England**, implementing them will both improve the quality of the data held by **CORE** to support **REF2029** as well as increase the discoverability and
      visibility of the institutions' research outputs.
      
      We encourage institutions to expose their metadata using the **Rioxx v3** metadata schema which provides native support for exposing deposit dates. **CORE** provides a
      metadata validator for **Rioxx v3** in the **CORE Dashboard** and can provide methodological advice to Supporting and Sustaining members
      for implementing **Rioxx v3**.
    content2: |
      Below is an example of a RIOXX record with all recommended fields populated:

          **1. Make sure that your institutional repository/ies are registered in CORE:**
        description: |
          We are constantly working towards **CORE** indexing all repositories available. However, as repositories sometimes change
          their web locations, platforms or some institutions introduce multiple repositories, we advise institutions to check that
          their repositories are registered and listed on the **CORE's** data providers page.
      - title: |
          **2. Adopt RIOXX as a data format:**
        description: |
          One of the key reasons for the development of the **Rioxx** metadata profile was
          to help institutions achieve compliance with the original **REF 2021** Open Access Policy. While **CORE** can capture the data
          from repositories not supporting **RIOXX**, supporting **RIOXX** greatly reduces the complexity of the algorithm through which
          **CORE** acquires the data. The below recommendations detail which information should be shared in the metadata and
          how this information should be exposed in **RIOXX**. We further provide an example **RIOXX** metadata record with all
          information needed for **REF 2029** correctly set.
      - title: |
          **3. Add DOIs to records you are planning to submit to REF:**
        description: |
          To ensure the **REF** research outputs can be unambiguously matched to the metadata in the repository, we recommend
          that institutions ensure that **DOIs** (or other persistent identifiers such as PubMed ID, where appropriate) are added to
          records to be submitted to **REF**. This should be done sufficiently in advance of the audit taking place for all outputs where
          **DOI** has been assigned. According to **RIOXX**, **DOI** of the resource should be put in the rioxxterms:version_of_record field.
      - title: |
          **4. Release deposit dates publicly, so that they are indexable by CORE:**
        description: |
          Following the release of **RIOXX V3**, The deposit_date is an attribute within the <dc:relation> property. If included, this
          attribute's value must be encoded according to the **W3CDTF** (a profile of **ISO 8601**) which typically follows the following
          format: YYYY-MM-DD.
      - title: |
          **5. We encourage repositories to expose the deposit date for each research output:**
        description: |
          Even when **RIOXX** is not implemented, and ideally to mark it as "Date Deposited:". For example, EPrints repositories
          typically display the deposit date on the page of a given record (an example at Open Research Online). This date must be
          the date of the **first compliant deposit**. We rely on the definition of
          **first compliant deposit**.
      - title: |
          **6. Ensure that all records to be submitted to REF have a full text linked directly from the dc:identifier:**
        description: |
          According to the **RIOXX** standard, the dc:identifier field must contain an HTTP URI which is a link directly pointing to the
          described resource, i.e. to the MS Word, PDF or another version of the manuscript. This field should be populated for all
          records your institution is planning to submit to the **REF** and should appear exactly once in the record, so that the
          availability of the output in the repository can be automatically checked.
      - title: |
          **7. Ensure that your repository OAI-PMH endpoint is operational:**
        description: |
          The **OAI-PMH** endpoint in your repository enables aggregators to collect data from your repository. The Confederation of
          Open Access Repositories (**COAR**) states that the real benefits of repositories come from interoperability which gives us
          the ability to exchange data within a network. This is currently realised by the **OAI-PMH** protocol. In the majority of cases,
          the **OAI-PMH** endpoint will be correctly working in your repository by default. To check its operation there are freely
          available validators that ensure the correct response of the endpoint. However, the validator does not fully ensure that
          the data from the repository could be indexed without issues, which could be a potential problem, especially for larger
          repositories. Any repository can register freely for the **CORE Repository Dashboard**
          account which enables the repository
          to check its indexing status.

    title: 4. How CORE aggregation supports HEIs for REF2029
    items:
      - title: |
          **1. Individual HEIs have a local and incomplete view of compliance:**
        description: |
          An output deposited late to a repository maintained by one institution can still be compliant due to a timely
          deposit at another repository. Research collaborations are international, i.e. the **first compliant deposit** can be to
          an overseas repository and this could also include non-institutional subject repositories, such as **arXiv**. While a few
          institutions are involved in cross-institutional checking for possible external deposit, this practice requires human
          labour and is limited only to cooperating institutions. **CORE** has a global and more complete view over the data
          and can provide technology that will effectively support institutions in better understanding which outputs are
          compliant and which are not even prior to the **REF** submission.
      - title: |
          **2. Open Access uptake monitoring:**
        description: |
          A key intention of the original **REF 2021 OA Policy** was to increase the proportion of OA outputs and decrease the
          time lag between acceptance and deposit. As a significant proportion of web transactions for accessing research
          papers is to recent papers, if research becomes available earlier in repositories than on publisher platforms and is,
          in addition, available without a paywall, this will a) significantly increase the importance of the repository
          infrastructure, b) accelerate research dissemination by making the scholarly communication process more
          efficient and c) provide better value to citizens. Citing Lord Kelvin's "If you cannot measure it, you can not improve
          it," it is crucial, for any policy, that its uptake can be monitored and improvements measured at any time. By
          capturing this information at an aggregation level, we are enabling precisely that. For example, if institutions were
          to deliver deposit dates to **Research England** as a one-off in csv only at the time of **REF** submission, this would not
          allow such monitoring, as it would only provide deposit dates for a small subsample of content in repositories and
          only at one point in time. It is crucial to realise that the importance of the **REF Open Access policy** goes far beyond
          **REF**. The practice of depositing early should prevail beyond the **REF** as we should be able to monitor our journey to
          not just open access but also to fast open access. In the future, similar policies (e.g. due to **Plan S**) will require
          similar monitoring, so it makes sense to get ready now.
      - title: |
          **3. Audit transparency:**
        description: |
          Exposing deposit dates and other important information in a machine readable format in support of the audit
          through repositories ensures transparency of the audited data. Everyone can check the data that not only gets
          submitted but also that is about to get submitted, ensuring good preparation leading to no surprises. Overall,
          transparency is a key to good research practices and open science. It also often leads to more attention resulting
          in improvement of processes and better quality data.
      - title: |
          **4. Efficiency:**
        description: |
          Collecting data through an aggregation is by far the most efficient method of assembling the data. Where systems
          are already in place, it does not require any manual work or action. Any work likely to be conducted improves the
          repository infrastructure resulting in a positive change across the sector. As it is expected that similar audits
          might need to be carried out in the future, it is sensible to automate this process now.
      - title: |
          **Verifiability:**
        description: |
          Assembling data at an aggregation level offers verifiability of the declared data. While this hasn't been
          implemented so far, it will be possible to test both the presence and machine availability of the full text, which is
          key to many use cases, including text and data mining. Exposing data, such as deposit dates, will also be seen as
          a positive development by publishers. From the perspective of CORE, our intention to test these points is
          motivated purely by our strive to feedback any issues back to repositories and support them in creating a better
          and more interoperable repository infrastructure, which we all deserve.
  - id: how-core-collects
    title: 5. How CORE collects this information
    subTitle: Technical methods for data collection
    caption: Data Collection
    content: |
      **CORE** regularly indexes data from repositories in a permanent and ongoing cycle. If all the recommendations described above are followed, then the procedure is
      straightforward. If any deviations are present, **CORE** will try to collect the data in alternative ways. These include:
      
      * if **RIOXX** is not supported: **CORE** will gather metadata, such as information about the identifier and **DOIs**, using standard **DC**.
      
      * If **DOIs** are not available: If **DOIs** are not available for some records, **CORE** will use available metadata to match these records against several key databases, including **Crossref** to discover the **DOIs**.
      
      **If the date of publication is not supplied:** If the date of publication is not supplied by the repository or it doesn't have the desired granularity (we prefer **ISO 8601** (post–2004 versions) which follows the
      following format: YYYY-MM-DD), **CORE** will collect the publication date from **Crossref**. Where the publication date is supplied by the repository but the date is not the
      same as in **Crossref**, the decision as to which one will be used in the audit will be up to the discretion of **Research England**.
      
      * As deposit dates are not part of standard **DC** and not yet part of **RIOXX**, **CORE** therefore implements the following two methods for collecting them:
      
      1. **Web scraping:** Where deposit dates are visible through the web pages in the repository, **CORE** attempts to collect them by scraping them, i.e. extracting the data from the
      web page of the record, using custom built scrapers for a variety of repository platforms.
      
      2. **Datestamp method:** Where deposit dates cannot be obtained using scraping, **CORE** makes use of the record's Datestamp provided in the record's metadata. This is done in the
      following way. **CORE** stores the first Datestamp it receives for a given record, i.e. the first time **CORE** indexes the record, as the deposit date. Subsequent
      changes to the Datestamp, which could be due to the record's updates, will not affect the deposit date. Due to the frequent indexing, this provides a close
      estimation of the deposit date.
      
      This describes the method we use to collect data from repositories that currently do not support **RIOXX**. We might update this method if we identify a way of improving it,
      such as to make the data we collect more accurate.
      
      When on rare occasions the collected data might be incomplete, it will be up to the discretion of **Research England** performing the audit to interpret the data. We believe
      that if a record present in the repository has not been indexed by **CORE** or it was not possible to capture some metadata, this should not negatively affect the audit result.
      To this end, our aim is to support institutions to identify and resolve any issues prior to the audit.

  - id: how-can-core-help
    title: 6. How can CORE help you?
    content: |
      Sets the vision for creating the **CORE** service, developing global-wide content aggregation of all open access research literature (on top of **OAI-PMH** protocol for metadata harvesting and other protocols). It sets the mission to develop the three access levels (access at the granularity of papers; analytical access; access to raw data) via **CORE**.
