  title: CORE support for UK HEIs for REF 2029
  description: |
    As UK institutions' focus begins to turn to **REF2029**, we continue
    our efforts to provide **CORE** members and UK HEIs with the most
    up to date information possible.
    
    The purpose of this document is to provide advice and
    recommendations to UK HEIs with regards to exposing data to
    **CORE** through their repositories to ensure optimum
    discoverability for Open Access scholarly articles.
    
    In this document, we use the term repository to refer to a system
    that the HEI will use for the purposes of **REF2029** as defined in the
    **Open Access Policy for REF2029**.
