  title: CORE support for UK HEIs for REF 2029
  description: |
    As UK institutions’ focus begins to turn to REF2029, we continue our efforts to provide CORE members and UK HEIs with the most up to date information possible. The **purpose of this document** is to **provide advice** and **recommendations** to UK HEIs **with regards to exposing data to CORE** through their repositories to ensure optimum **discoverability** for Open Access scholarly articles.
    
    In this document, we use the term repository to refer to a system that the HEI will use for the purposes as defined in the Open Access Policy for REF2029
