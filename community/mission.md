description: Too often as researchers we exist within our own disciplines and
  institutes, each in our own silos, disconnected from each other. The CORE
  Researcher Network provides opportunities for those working with CORE data to
  engage and collaborate with others from within and across disciplines.
  Connecting disparate researchers and research teams to mutually beneficial
  ends is a key tenet in creating this network. By fostering these connections
  we can work together to better understand the nature of our own, and other,
  domains.
