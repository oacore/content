    - title: University of Chicago adopts CORE’s article deduplication tool
      description: We do not have a duplicate check built into our repository, so CORE’s duplicate check is immensely helpful. While other repositories might already have duplicate checks, I don’t know about their usage of ML to find duplicates. Based on my experience, I would guess that it isn’t as accurate if it relies primarily on exact matches. CORE’s duplicate check displays the “confidence” it has that a record is duplicated in the repository, which is also helpful when determining the final decision on whether a duplicate record...

    - title: How the CORE Metadata Validator supports integration of Rioxx v3 in DSpace
      description: With the rollout of the Rioxx V3 metadata schema, repositories can benefit from far richer metadata for their articles. Since the release of the updated schema, The University of Cambridge has been working to develop an implementation of a RIOXX v3 for DSpace-based repositories which will greatly simplify the adoption of this metadata schema. The implementation process and verification of the metadata has been supported by the CORE Rioxx v3 validator available in the CORE Dashboard...
