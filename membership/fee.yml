      You can subscribe to CORE membership for three years, or for five years. Membership fees are paid annually. All fees are excluding VAT.

      *All fees are excluding VAT.
      
      ** This is the number of research outputs produced by your organisation rather than just the number of open access papers CORE has access to. We use this as a proxy for the size of an institution.
      
      We offer discounts to consortia of institutions subscribing to CORE Membership. To qualify for the consortia discount, there needs to be an established and active overarching operational structure of the consortium and the consortium must have public presence. The consortia cannot be formed for the sole purpose of just getting the discount. The consortium discount is provided as a proportion of the membership fees for which would otherwise be due should institutions forming the consortium became CORE Members individually. The discount is only provided if all of the institutions in the consortium become CORE Members.
      
      We invite consortia interested in becoming CORE Members to directly approach us at: **membership@core.ac.uk**
