    * We ensure that the recommended articles are available open access, ensuring that what
    gets recommended can also be freely read.
    * Our state-of-the-art recommendation algorithm makes use of article full texts, not just
    metadata, in addition to a wide range of other features. Read more on how the algorithm
    works in our [research](~research-outputs) section.
