    The recommender is a plugin for repositories, journal systems and web interfaces that provides suggestions
      on relevant articles to the one currently displayed. Its purpose is to support users in discovering
      articles of interest from across the network of open access repositories. We have validated that
      all recommended articles are free to read and can be accessed without a paywall. Thus, the CORE
      Recommender increases the visibility of open access content. Being open should pay off!
