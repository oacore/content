The recommender is a plugin that can be installed in repositories and journal
systems to suggest similar articles. Its purpose is to support users in
finding articles relevant to what they read.

The current version of the plugin recommends full-text items in Open Access
repositories that are related to:

* a metadata record a full-text item in pdf any piece of text any
* combination of the above

The CORE Recommender is deployed in [various locations](https://core.ac.uk/about/endorsements),
such as on the CORE Portal and in institutional repositories and journals.

Uniqueness of the CORE Recommender:

* Our methods rely on the availability of full-texts. We donâ€™t base our
* recommendations solely on abstracts or metadata. We ensure that the
* recommended articles are available open access. We provide our
* recommendation service for free. We provide it using a machine accessible
* interface ([API](https://core.ac.uk/services/api)).
