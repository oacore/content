      “The [CORE Repository Dashboard](https://core.ac.uk/services/repository-dashboard) provides an excellent level of
      feedback and control over what gets harvested, aggregated and exposed.
      It also provides intelligence on harvesting errors which may need
      troubleshooting, thereby ensuring optimum repository health for text mining
      as well as discovery of repository content.”
