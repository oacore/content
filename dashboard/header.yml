    It offers a range of tools for repository management,
    content enrichment, metadata quality assessment and open access
    compliance checking. It serves as a central hub for accessing
    member services for data providers, such as to  configure
    CORE’s [OAI Resolver](https://core.ac.uk/documentation/oai-resolver), Recommender and Discovery services
    for your repository or to promote your organisation to millions
    of CORE’s users.
