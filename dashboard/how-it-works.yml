    The Repository Dashboard provides an online interface offering
    valuable technical information and statistics for content providers.
    It is the tool you need to check that your repository is
    configured correctly to provide maximum visibility to your research
    outputs. Additional features include OAI Resolver resolution,
    persistent identifiers (PIDs) enrichments, access to repository tools
    enhancing user experience (Recommender and Discovery) and ability to
    promote your logos across the CORE ecosystem. For UK members,
    it also offers REF Open Access compliance monitoring and a RIOXX
    metadata quality validator.
