title: What is CORE?
description: |
  CORE provides access to the worldâ€™s largest collection of open access research papers, collecting and indexing research from repositories and journals. It is a not-for-profit service dedicated to the open access mission and one of the signatories of the Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructures [POSI](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/posse/).
  
  We serve the global network of repositories and journals increasing discoverability and preventing misuse of their content; making metadata records uniquely identifiable and resolvable with decentralised PIDs; supporting data providers in adopting good practices by providing tools for metadata validation, content management, enrichment and OA compliance; and facilitating machine access to open research.
  
  Our services support a wide range of stakeholders in getting scalable access to our vast and comprehensive collection of data, specifically researchers, the general public, academic institutions, developers, funders as well as companies from a diverse range of sectors including but not limited to innovators, AI technology companies, digital library solutions and pharma.
