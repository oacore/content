title: About CORE
description: >
  CORE (COnnecting REpositories) provides a comprehensive bibliographic database
  of the world’s scholarly literature, collecting and indexing research from
  repositories and journals. It is, to our knowledge, also the world’s largest
  collection of full text open access research papers. CORE is a not-for-profit
  service dedicated to the open access mission and one of the signatories of the
  Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructures
  [POSI](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/posse/).


  We serve the global network of repositories and journals increasing discoverability and preventing misuse of their content; making metadata records uniquely identifiable and resolvable with decentralised PIDs; supporting data providers in adopting good practices by providing tools for metadata validation, content management, enrichment and OA compliance; and facilitating machine access to open research.


  Our services support a wide range of stakeholders in getting scalable access to our vast and comprehensive collection of data, specifically researchers, the general public, academic institutions, developers, funders as well as companies from a diverse range of sectors including but not limited to innovators, AI technology companies, digital library solutions and pharma.
