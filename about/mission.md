CORE’s mission is to index all research worldwide
and deliver unrestricted access for all.

In doing so, we:

* enrich scholarly data using state-of-the-art text and data mining
  technologies to aid  discoverability,
* enable others to develop new tools and use cases on top
  of the CORE platform,
* support the network of [open access repositories and journals](~how-core-supports-open-access)
  with innovative technical, solutions and,
* facilitate a scalable, cost-effective route for the delivery
  of open scholarship.



**15 years of CORE**

In 2025, CORE marks 15 years of continuous development, innovation, and community collaboration. From a research project exploring how to connect UK repositories, CORE has grown into the world’s largest index of open access research literature serving over 400 million records and enabling machine access to over 40 million full text documents. Throughout this journey, CORE has remained committed to responsible infrastructure, good metadata practices, and the open access mission.

To commemorate this milestone, we’ve created a visual roadmap highlighting key achievements across five phases of our development. From foundational tools and global coverage to policy impact, AI innovation, and renewed community engagement. But this is more than a celebration of the past. It is a recommitment to co-designing trustworthy, equitable, responsible and intelligent open research infrastructure for the future.
