COREâ€™s mission is to aggregate all open access research worldwide
and deliver unrestricted access for all.

In doing so, we:

* enrich scholarly data using state-of-the-art text and data mining
  technologies to aid  discoverability,
* enable others to develop new tools and use cases on top
  of the CORE platform,
* support the network of open access repositories and journals
  with innovative technical, solutions and,
* facilitate a scalable, cost-effective route for the delivery
  of open scholarship.
