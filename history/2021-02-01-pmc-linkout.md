This development now enables PubMed users to access full text links to articles hosted in CORE via its LinkOut service, providing researchers with a direct route to the research. The linking of CORE papers directly from PubMed resources and other related databases further increases the discoverability of content aggregated by CORE, providing a valuable service to our repositories.
