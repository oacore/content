A series of small grants and engagements eventually leads to the CORE team landing a multiyear national open access aggregator service contract with Jisc. CORE joins the Jisc Open Access Services portfolio, but the team delivering CORE stays at the Open University, in a bilateral agreement of Jisc with the Open University in which both institutions commit to supporting CORE. 

From a technical perspective, this enables CORE to develop its services along the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) paradigm and put in place the required hardware for the service provision.
