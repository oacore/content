A new research grant called DiggiCORE provides a necessary degree of stability for the development of CORE and allows expanding and improving the technology. 

This is the time when CORE manages to scale out its functionality to harvest, process and analyse not just metadata of open access research papers but their full texts too. This processing of full texts becomes a defining feature of CORE, connecting full text research papers from across repositories globally. It is a clear response to the need of going beyond poor quality metadata only silos on which it is hardly possible to develop engaging services.
