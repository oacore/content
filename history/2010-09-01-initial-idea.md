title: Initial idea developed
---
Petr Knoth comes up with the idea of aggregating research papers as part of his doctoral work at the Knowledge media institute, The Open University. He recognises that research papers are scattered across many systems limiting their reuse potential. He is motivated by the opportunity to connect repositories by aggregating open access papers so that research papers can be text-mined, enabling the development of innovative technologies for information access. He becomes a strong supporter of the open access movement and open access repositories, wanting to see democratisation of knowledge generated using tax-payersâ€™ money.
