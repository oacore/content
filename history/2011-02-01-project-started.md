The first grant for CORE is awarded by Jisc in January and the project commences on 1st February 2011, initiating a long-term collaboration of the Open University and Jisc (which is not yet known at this time). CORE embarks on a mission to facilitate free, unrestricted access to research for all. 

CORE’s initial goal is to connect 20 repositories and provide a recommendation system for their papers. 

One of the project’s achievements is the integration of the CORE Plugin (later called CORE Recommender) into the Open University’s repository, Open Research Online. This is the first adopter with hundreds more to follow in the future. 

The project over-delivers, developing an aggregation engine for over 60 repositories, a recommender system, linked open data module and search and web UI. The funder (Jisc) is impressed, paving the way for new opportunities.
