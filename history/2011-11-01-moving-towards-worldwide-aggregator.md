Petr Knoth secures a new grant running for 9 months with the objective of developing a UK nationwide aggregation service for research publications scattered across institutional repositories. The potential of the system is demonstrated through the development of 5 services on top of the aggregation system: CORE Portal (with search), CORE Mobile, CORE Recommender and CORE API. 

The project again over-delivers, resulting not just in the aggregation of the vast majority of the UK repositories but quickly expanding, both technically and strategically, to aggregated research outputs from institutional repositories aggregated globally.
