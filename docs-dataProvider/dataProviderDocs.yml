      This section provides clarifications on the meaning of the terms used within this document.
      
       * **Data provider:** an institutional repository, journal, preprint server, etc. exposing content to CORE.
       * **Repository:** In this document, we use the term repository to denote the software platform of data providers. As a result, we sometimes use the term repository not only to refer to software platforms of institutional repositories but also to refer to platforms of journals and preprint servers.
       * **Landing page:** An HTML page in a repository where one typically enters when accessing a scholarly publication and from which one can access the associated resources.
       * **Full text:** The research manuscript.
       * **Content:** Refers to any data supplied by the data provider including metadata and full text.
       * **Record:** Metadata describing a single scholarly resource exposed by a repository
       * **Resource:** Any Web resource, such as an identifier, file or a webpage.
       * **Rioxx:** The Research Outputs Metadata Schema (Rioxx) was developed for institutional repositories to share metadata about the scholarly resources they contain.

  - title: 3.1.1 Ensuring your repository is visible via OAI-PMH (Required)
    id: oai-pmh
    descriptionAbout: |
      CORE uses the [Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)](https://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html) to regularly harvest and update the information it holds about its data providers. In order to get indexed, CORE data providers must expose information about their resources via OAI-PMH.
      
      It is a relatively common problem that the OAI-PMH endpoint of the data provider is misconfigured or not functional. This can occur even when other functionalities of the repository appear to be working without issues. It is therefore important that repositories monitor that their OAI-PMH endpoint remains functional. This can be done in several ways.

    id: registration
    descriptionAbout: >
      Can use the Open Archives [OAI-PMH validator](https://www.openarchives.org/Register/ValidateSite) tool. The tool expects an HTTP(s) URI of the OAI-PMH endpoint (also called the OAI-PMH base URL) and conducts a number of checks to assess the validity and correct configuration of the endpoint. If the validator returns errors, then these will need to be fixed prior to getting registered with CORE. It is advised that this step is conducted prior to attempting registration with CORE.

    descriptionAbout: >
      Can visit the CORE [data provider registration page](/benefits#join-core) and enter their OAI-PMH base URL. If the OAI-PMH base URL is valid, then the repository will be registered in CORE, subject to additional checks described in Section 4.1. It is important to note that checking that the OAI-PMH endpoint is configured correctly does not guarantee that it correctly exposes all the metadata records from the repository system. This can only be checked once CORE has attempted harvesting of the repository.

  - title: Data providers already registered in CORE
    descriptionAbout: >
      Registered data providers can claim access to the [CORE Dashboard](/services/repository-dashboard) in accordance with the procedure described in Section 4.2. The Dashboard provides access to a harvesting report, which includes information such as, the last time of successful harvesting, the number of metadata and full text records found and indexed, any errors or warnings encountered during the harvesting process.

      **Figure 1. Sample Dashboard harvesting information for the Open University repository, Open Research Online**
    subDescription: It is not uncommon for the number of indexed metadata records in CORE to be slightly different from the number that the data provider might see in their repository system, as the Dashboard provides an independent outside view of the repository. Deviations can occur due to a number of reasons, such as your repository not exposing all records through its OAI-PMH interface, some records being disabled or their metadata not meeting the minimum quality requirements. As a result, we recommend that data providers regularly check and resolve any errors and warnings indicated on the Dashboard.
  - title: 3.1.3 Use of OAI-PMH sets (Required)
    id: oai-pmh-usage
    descriptionAbout: >
      [OAI-PMH](https://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#SelectiveHarvesting) allows data providers to segment the content of their repository flexibly. CORE can use the capabilities of OAI-PMH selective harvesting to limit harvesting requests to portions of the metadata available from a repository. It is recommended that if repositories want CORE to limit its indexing only to a portion of the repository, then they should contact the CORE team for support.

    id: oai-identifier
    descriptionAbout: >
      An OAI (Open Archives Initiative) identifier is a unique identifier of a metadata record minted in a decentralised manner. OAI identifiers are formed using a globally unique prefix and a locally unique suffix. Together they form a globally unique identifier of a metadata record.
    images:
      - file: /images/docs-membership/OAI.svg
    subTitle: >
      **Figure 2. OAI identifier**
    subDescription: >
      CORE registers OAI identifiers supplied by repositories during the harvesting process and use them to deliver a global [OAI Resolver](https://oai.core.ac.uk) service. The use of OAI Identifiers is automatic for data providers supporting OAI-PMH. However, it is important that these identifiers are correctly managed. Specifically:
      
      
      * Every metadata record indexed by CORE must have an OAI ID.
      
      * Repositories that declare their level of support for deleted documents in the **deletedRecord** element of the Identify response as persistent. CORE recommends repositories to provide this persistent level of support. CORE recommends that  repositories never regenerate OAI IDs for their records, for instance during migration to new repository software, previously assigned OAI IDs should remain unchanged.
      
      * Data providers should register their OAI prefix and mapping on the Settings tab of the CORE Dashboard. This will prevent OAI ID conflicts and ensure that the OAI Resolver service can correctly link resources supplied by your repository to their respective repository landing page.
      
      
      OAI IDs will resolve to the landing page of the repository when configured correctly. If the OAI Resolver is misconfigured for your repository, then linking to your content might produce errors. If your repository does not support linking to landing pages via the OAI Resolver or you disable it for your repository, then CORE will resolve OAI IDs to the version of the record in CORE (instead of linking to your repository).

  - title: 3.1.5 Access for machine agents - (Required)
    id: machine-agents
    descriptionAbout: >
      A robots.txt file provides a commonly used mechanism with which the webmaster can limit access to a website for machine agents, such as crawlers, and control the load on the server. The CORE agent obeys information in the robots.txt file. As a result, if the repository has a robots.txt file, then the CORE agent must be allowed access.
      
      
      It is therefore important that:
      
      
      * The “core” agent is allowed to access the repository, including the landing pages and the full text files
      
      * No crawl-delay should be specified for the “core” agent. As repositories often contain tens of thousands of records, it is important to understand that a crawl-delay of just 10s, could result in the inability to harvest the repository within a reasonable time frame. This is also why some search engines, such as Google, ignore this directive.

    descriptionAbout: >
      CORE uses established open registries of repositories, such as [OpenDOAR](https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/opendoar/), to identify new data providers of open access content. It is therefore advisable that your repository is included in an international repositories list and that the OAI-PMH base URL is kept up to date in that registry. Apart from repositories, CORE also automatically indexes content from journals in the [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org), several preprint servers and scholarly works that have PIDs registered in [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org).

  - title: 3.1.7 Meta-tags (Recommended)
    id: meta-tags
    descriptionAbout: >
      Meta-tags describe webpage content using code, which makes the content visible to machines rather than humans. Crawlers of harvesting services, like CORE, rely on meta-tags in the webpage to be able to determine if the page they are on represents a scholarly document. There is a helpful list of meta-tags that are useful to aggregators [here](https://scholar.google.co.uk/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html#indexing). Failure to add meta-tags may result in crawlers making guesses about the content, or completely omitting it.
      
      
      The meta-tags CORE recommends are:
      
      
      * Title
      
      * Author
      
      * Publication date
      
      * Journal title (or conference title)

    id: rioxx
    descriptionAbout: >
      CORE recommends that repositories use [RIOXX v3](https://rioxx.net/profiles/v3-0-final/), which we consider to be the most suitable metadata application profile for describing scholarly research outputs. Rioxx: The Research Outputs Metadata Schema was developed for institutional repositories to share metadata about the scholarly resources they contain. Originally designed to meet the reporting requirements of [Research Councils UK (RCUK)](https://www.ukri.org), Rioxx has also proved to be useful as a standard for sharing metadata between repositories and network services such as large-scale metadata aggregators like CORE. Rioxx focuses on applying consistency to the metadata fields used for identifiers of scholarly outputs, people and organisations, research funders and project/grants, and is designed to support the consistent tracking of open-access research publications across scholarly systems.
      
      
      Rioxx has several benefits over other schemas, including:
      
      
      * It has been designed with a particular focus on enabling efficient data exchange between repositories and machine agents, making harvesting run faster and more accurately due to avoiding ambiguity in linking metadata describing resources, such as full texts, datasets and software, and the resources themselves.
      
      * It provides comprehensive capabilities for describing a wide range of scholarly properties useful in reporting and analysing research, such as grant IDs, project IDs, funder IDs, licensing information, etc.
      
      * The Rioxx schema is compatible with and logically integrates with other protocols for machine access to scholarly documents, specifically [Signposting](https://signposting.org) and [ResourceSync](https://www.openarchives.org/rs/1.1/resourcesync).
      
      * It provides mechanisms for distinguishing resources under the custodianship of the repository from those under external custodianship, enabling CORE to prefer linking to the repository where possible (and appropriate) instead of linking externally to the publisher's website.
      
      
      CORE provides a [metadata validator for data providers supporting Rioxx](/membership-documentation#rioxx-validator) in the CORE Dashboard.

    descriptionAbout: >
      CORE requires that the full text must be hosted on the same domain or subdomains as the OAI-PMH endpoint. This is to ensure that content of other external data providers linked from the repository is not treated as content belonging to the repository. Exceptions are made where the domain is owned by the same organisation. We advise data providers to contact us in those circumstances.
    images: null
    subTitle: null
    subDescription: >
      **Example Scenario**


      **Same domain hosting**
      

      The fictional organisation “We Love Open Access”, has an OAI-PMH endpoint at
      
      https://weloveopenaccess.org/cgi/oai2. By default, CORE accepts any papers hosted as follows:

      * https://weloveopenaccess.org/files/paper.pdf
      
      Notice that the files and the OAI-PMH endpoint are hosted on the same domain (weloveopenaccess.org).


      **Subdomain hosting**
      

      We can accept the following setup, but please contact us to allow a specific exception:
      
      * https://files.weloveopenaccess.org/files/paper.pdf (with exception)
      
      * https://weloveopenaccess-files.org/files/paper.pdf (with exception)


      **Out-of-domain hosting with a dedicated repository content section**
      

      We may also accept where there is a clear link between the owner of the OAI-PMH and the hosting website:

      * https://parent-organisation.org/weloveopenaccess/files/paper.pdf (with exception and proof of ownership)


      **Out-of-domain hosting**
      

      CORE does not support this option.

      * https://publisher-website.com/files/paper.pdf


      CORE does not allow indexing full texts hosted on shared services such as Dropbox, Google Drive or OneDrive.

  - title: 3.3.3 Linking to the full text of an article
    id: linking-full-text

      For CORE to successfully index full text content, it must be linked in one of the following ways:
    images: null
    subTitle: null
    subDescription: null
  - title: i. Direct link to the full text (Recommended)
    id: Direct-full-text
    descriptionAbout: >
      CORE recommends that data providers provide an unambiguous link to the full text in the metadata. The correct linking strategy depends on the employed metadata schema.
    images: null
    subTitle: null
    subDescription: >
      **Dublin Core (Minimum)**
      
      
      Where Dublin Core is used, it is recommended to provide a direct link to the full text in the first occurrence of dc:identifier.
      
      
      \<dc:identifier>http://oro.open.ac.uk/37823/1/jcdl2013_v7.pdf</dc:identifier>
      
      
      EPrints follows this recommendation by default. This approach significantly reduces the load that CORE places on the repository during indexing.
      
      
      If this is not possible, then CORE can index the content if there is a well-defined link in the metadata that directs to a machine-accessible document (either PDF, or Microsoft Word doc/docx format). 
      
      
      **Rioxx v3 (Recommended)**
      
      
      In Rioxx v3, the data provider links to the landing page in dc:identifier and the lists the direct link to the full text in dc:relation specifying the rel=”item” property with the type=”application/pdf”
      
      
      **Example**

  - title: ii. Indirect link to the full text (Supported)
    id: indirect-link
    descriptionAbout: >
      CORE will automatically detect where the data provider does not specify the link to the full text directly, as described above. In such cases, the CORE indexer will visit the landing page, collect links from it, just as a human user would, trying to locate the link to the document on the page.
      
      
      To validate that CORE found the correct full text, i.e. full text matching the metadata record, CORE runs a process to match the title of the record with the title contained in the pdf. This process is not 100% accurate, causes extra load on the server and requires more processing time per document. This does not work for documents requiring OCR and they will be thus discarded.
      
      
      Resolvers and registries such as [handle.net](http://handle.net) and [doi.org](http://doi.org) are supported in this scenario. When external resolution services, such as [Handle.Net](http://hdl.handle.net) or [doi](https://dx.doi.org), are used, it is important to ensure that the URL produced works properly, and it links to an actual document and not to a dead page. However, as these services frequently use (chained) HTTP redirection mechanisms, this significantly slows down the indexing process and therefore this approach is not desirable.
      
      
      As a result, we strongly recommend following our “Direct link to the fulltext” guidelines described above. These guidelines enable CORE to run more efficiently, place less load on the repository and improve the overall accuracy of each harvest. Where an indirect link to the full text approach is used, it is recommended that the repository implements [FAIR Signposting](https://signposting.org/FAIR/), which enables the machine agent to navigate from the landing page to the full text resource.

    id: fair-signposting
    descriptionAbout: >
      Pages that host scholarly articles are designed with human viewers in mind, those pages are not optimised for use by machine agents that navigate the scholarly web. Signposting caters to machine agents by providing metadata, links to documents and more, in a standards-based way, using [Typed Links](https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml) as a means to clarify patterns that occur repeatedly in scholarly portals.
      
      
      As an administrator of a repository platform that hosts research outputs, you can help machines to navigate the information systems you manage by implementing the [FAIR Signposting Profile](https://signposting.org/FAIR/) that provides concrete recipes aimed at uniformity across systems.
      
      
      Signposting has especially significant benefits in the case of indirect linking. It allows CORE to navigate from the landing page to the resources in an unambiguous and efficient manner using HTTP Headers.

      In the form, you will be asked to provide your OAI-PMH based URL and your institutional email address. Start by submitting the OAI base URL of your data provider into the provided form. CORE has an automatic system that guesses the OAI URL from your normal URL, so if you don’t know the URL at first you can try to use your repository homepage URL first.
      
      Next, add the email address of the contact person. This email address will be used by CORE to notify the contact once the repository has been included in CORE and harvested for the first time.

    id: indexing
    descriptionAbout: >
      Once registered, CORE will begin indexing your content. The time required for this process can vary. Repositories are placed in an indexing queue and scheduled for harvesting according to a range of criteria.
      
      
      Several factors can influence the speed of harvesting, including the size of your repository (larger repositories may take longer to process), technical issues (any technical issues that arise during the process can cause delays), and system workload. i.e. the overall workload on the CORE system at the time of your request. All these may affect how quickly CORE can process a new repository.
      
      
      Once the harvesting process has been completed, CORE will send a notification to the designated contact. This email will contain a link to the data provider's CORE profile page. Note that the repository content will only be visible on the CORE website after the harvesting process has been entirely finished. Once this has completed, the repository manager can claim access to the CORE Dashboard account.

Repository managers are invited to gain free access to the [CORE Dashboard](/services/repository-dashboard). The claiming procedure requires that the authenticity of the repository manager is validated by means of confirming access to the email address of the registered contact listed in the OAI-PMH administrator field. Once validated, access to the CORE Dashboard is granted.
      
      
      The Dashboard also provides the opportunity to check and to revise your OAI-PMH base URL, link your repository [ROR ID](https://ror.org), register your OAI prefix for the CORE OAI Resolver and to upload the data provider’s logo used across the CORE services ecosystem.
