  Are the research papers offered by CORE peer-reviewed?
---
Yes it does. CORE harvests content from repositories and journals. The first
do not perform peer review of the deposited content but the latter
do. In some occassions the content deposited in a repository is already
published in a journal and is peer-reviewed. In addition, repositories may contain
grey literature and these resources are not peer-reviewed.
