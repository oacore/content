  What is my journal’s/repository’s OAI base URL?
category: 'Aggregation: Technical'
---
OAI base URL looks similar to `http://journaldomain.com/cgi/oai2` or
`http://journaldomain.com/oai/request` when homepage URL is
`http://journaldomain.com`. CORE cannot harvest the
journal’s/repository’s content via its webpage URL.
If you are not sure whether your journal/repository has an OAI base
URL, [contact our team](~contact) and we will provide
technical support to you.
