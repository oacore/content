  CORE harvests from DOAJ but I cannot find my journal which is already
  registered in DOAJ.
category: Joining CORE as data provider
---
CORE harvests DOAJ as a single entry, which means that each journal
title does not appear separately in CORE. If you wish to have a
separate entry for your journal in CORE, do [send us](~contact) the
journal's OAI base URL and we will create a new entry.
