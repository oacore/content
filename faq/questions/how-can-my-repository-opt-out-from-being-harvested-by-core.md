  How can my repository opt out from being harvested by CORE?
---
CORE uses information from various registries, such as
[OpenDOAR](http://opendoar.org/), to include new repositories,
journals and archives into CORE. If the circumstances have changed in
your repository, you can restrict harvesting and crawling activities
by modifying your rules in your “robots.txt” file by using the
[Standard for Robots Exclusion](http://www.robotstxt.org/orig.html).
This will also guarantee the content cannot be cached by search
engines and harvesting systems. In addition, you could withdraw your
repository from all open access registries lists; when this takes
place, please [notify us](~contact).
