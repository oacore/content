  Why should deposit dates be provided by aggregators and not by
  single institutions?
---
Due to cross university collaborations some outputs that could be
considered non-compliant due to a late deposit may be compliant
due to a deposit that was made within the policy timeframe at
another institution or subject repository. Individual institutions
could benefit as they might not be fully aware of all compliant
outputs and might consider some of their outputs non-compliant,
while in fact they are compliant.
