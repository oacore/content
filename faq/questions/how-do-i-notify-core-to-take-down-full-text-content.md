  How do I notify CORE to take down full text content?
---
If full text content appears in CORE but not in the
hosting service your repository manager can take it down via the
[CORE Repository Dashboard](~services/repository-dashboard)
anytime without notifying us. Alternatively, you can use the
[update or remove article form](/article-update).
