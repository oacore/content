  Can CORE offer any statistics about the content it harvests?

CORE can offer repository or journal full text download statistics per month via the
[CORE Repository Dashboard](~services/repository-dashboard) but is not in position
to offer single item downloads yet. If you do not have access to the
Dashboard [contact us](~contact).
