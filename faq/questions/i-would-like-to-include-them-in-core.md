  them in CORE.
category: Joining CORE as data provider

CORE is a harvesting service and is not similar to research
networking sites, e.g. ResearchGate or Academia.edu, where authors
can deposit papers, so please do not email us the full text of your
papers. If you have deposited your articles in a repository
[let us know](~contact) the name of the repository.
There are chances that we harvest it already and if we donâ€™t we could
start harvesting it.
