  What can I do?

Log in to the [CORE Repository Dashboard](~services/repository-dashboard)
and look under the issues tab. Examine whether CORE has the correct oai base
url of your repository or if there are any technical issues listed there.
If there are no technical issues or you do not have an account for the CORE
Repository Dashboard [contact us](~contact).
