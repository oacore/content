  How do I register my repository or journal with CORE?
category: Joining CORE as data provider
---
CORE uses information from various registries, such as
[OpenDOAR](http://opendoar.org/) and [DOAJ](https://doaj.org/),
to include new repositories and journals into CORE.
If your repository or journal is already registered with
some authoritative registry, you don't need to do anything.
If your repository or journal has not been registered
yet use [the form](~register-data-provider) to add it.
