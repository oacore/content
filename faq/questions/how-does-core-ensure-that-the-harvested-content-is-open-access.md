  How does CORE ensure that the harvested content is Open Access?
category: Removing full text or metadata
---
CORE aggregates content from repositories registered in
[OpenDOAR](http://www.opendoar.org), journals registered
in [DOAJ](http://www.doaj.org) or those content providers that
requested their content to be aggregated. This means that all the
content sources aggregated by CORE must be open access as this is a
requirement for the providers to be included in these registries.
According to the official [BOAI definition of open
access](http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/openaccess/boai-10-recommendations),
CORE is allowed to, _"distribute, search, or link to the full
texts of articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data
to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without
financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those
inseparable from gaining access to the Internet itself. The only
constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for
copyright in this domain is to give authors control over the
integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged
and cited."_
