  A metadata record with a full text PDF does not appear in CORE from my
  own repository but it has been harvested from another repository. What
  if the record was not deposited on time at the other repository. Will
  this have an impact with regards to the REF2021 compliance?

CORE can identify deposits of the same articles from across
repositories. By doing so, an output deposited late in repository A
could be technically compliant provided that it was deposited within
the timeframe at repository B, i.e. the earliest deposit date
irrespective of the repository could be used. However, for the time
being, CORE agreed to supply the data to Research England and it will
be up the discretion of Research England to interpret the data. We
understand that the motivation is to mark outputs as non-compliant
only in cases where there is clear evidence that they are truly
non-compliant.
