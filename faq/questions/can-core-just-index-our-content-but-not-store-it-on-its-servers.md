  Can CORE just index our content, but not store it on its servers?
---
To provide its service, it is essential for CORE to be able to store
a cached copy of the harvested content. This is needed to verify open
access sources, offer analytical services, support text and data mining,
recommendation tools, etc. By cashing a copy of the harvested
resource, CORE is not different from many commercial and
non-commercial, academic and non-academic, search engines including
Google or CiteSeerX.
The primary difference from such systems is that CORE caches only
copies of open access content. More information on the benefits of
this approach is available in the “[CORE: Three Access Levels to
Underpin Open Access](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november12/knoth/11knoth.html)”
article.
