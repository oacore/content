If you have access to the CORE Repositories Dashboard, log into the
[CORE Repository Dashboard](~services/repository-dashboard) and you will get the
instructions on how to download the
[CORE Recommender](~services/recommender).
Otherwise, visit our recommender
[registration page](/recommender/register),
where you will also find the installation instructions. Repository
managers are highly recommended to use the CORE Repositories
Dashboard.
