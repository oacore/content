  When will the harvesting process of my repository be completed?
category: 'Aggregation: General'

Depending on the size of the repository and the existing traffic
in CORE's servers, the harvesting can last from a couple of hours
to a couple of weeks. If we experience any technical issues
during that period, we will get in touch.
