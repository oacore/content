  When I look at the papers I have authored, I am not pleased with the
  similar papers suggested by the CORE Recommender.
  How can I change that?

The CORE recommender uses the popular [content-based filtering
system](https://blog.core.ac.uk/2016/10/04/core-recommender/).
The similar resources that appear in the CORE Recommender and their
quality are highly impacted by the metadata information supplied by
the repository of origin. If that information is incorrect or
incomplete, you should contact the repository of origin. To improve
the CORE recommendations, you can use the feedback button, with
which you can remove any undesirable articles.
