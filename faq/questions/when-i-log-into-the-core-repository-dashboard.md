  When I log into the CORE Repository Dashboard in the “Content” tab I
  see a date. Is this date the deposit date that CORE has for the
  output?

CORE captures data as explained in the CORE recommendations. By
following our recommendations CORE should have the same deposit date
as the repository. The date you see in the CORE API is the date the
document was last seen in your repository and imported to CORE. The
date exposed in the CORE Repositories Dashboard uses instead a new
harvesting system that reads the “deposited date” exposed by your
own repository system.
