  I have removed an item from my repository, but the metadata are
  still visible in CORE
category: Removing full text or metadata

In order for the metadata to be removed from CORE they need to be
marked as "deleted/removed" in the repository. If the metadata are
marked as "restricted" CORE will still display it.
