title: "CORE harvests full text PDFs only. Does this mean that outputs with\nfull text in other formats, e.g.\_word documents or text files, will\nnot be considered as REF2021 compliant outputs?\n"
category: CORE guidance on REF2021 Audit
---
CORE harvests both metadata and full texts, currently only in PDF
format but we will include support for other formats in the future.
While the presence of the full text is preferred, CORE has all
information necessary to support the REF2021 audit as long as the
metadata of your outputs are in CORE. To minimise the possibility of
some of your outputs not being captured by CORE, please follow the
[CORE recommendations](/ref-audit).
