In order to realise the data transfer and regular data updates of
CORE and your system, CORE uses a variety of protocols to ingest
the content. The easiest way to get your content integrated with CORE
is the [OAI-PMH protocol](https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/).
If you wish to join CORE get in [touch](~contact).
