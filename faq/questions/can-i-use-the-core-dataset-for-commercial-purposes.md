  Can I use the CORE dataset for commercial purposes?

Please note the dataset has been created from information that was
publicly available on the Internet. Every effort has been made
to ensure this dataset contains only open access content.
We have included only content from repositories and journals that
are listed in registries where the condition for inclusion is the
provision of content under open access compatible license. However,
as metadata are often inconsistent, licensed information is often not
machine readable, and repositories from time to time leak information
that is not open access, we cannot take any responsibility for the
license of the content in the dataset. It is therefore up to the user
of this dataset to ensure that the way in which they use the dataset
does not breach copyright. The dataset is in no way intended for the
purposes of reading the original publications, but for machine
processing only.
