  A full text record is deleted from my repository, but is still
  available in CORE
category: Removing full text or metadata

COREâ€™s system is fully automated and relies on data made available
in a machine readable form. Our system understands that the
full text of a record was removed only when the record is marked
as deleted in the metadata of your repository. See
[how to take down full text](#how-do-I-notify-CORE-to-take-down-full-text-content)
from CORE in the related FAQ.
