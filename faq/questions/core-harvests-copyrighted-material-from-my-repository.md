  CORE harvests copyrighted material from my repository
category: Removing full text or metadata
---
COREâ€™s system is fully automated and relies on data made available
in a machine readable form. If your repository hosts full text with
a restrictive license that prohibits harvesting, this needs to be
properly communicated in a machine readable form. All non open
access items should be blocked in the robots.txt file. If this
information is provided in the metadata for each record and CORE
exposes the full text, please get in [touch](~contact) with us.
