  How is CORE different from Google Scholar?
---
Google Scholar is a search engine containing scholarly research papers but
it is not designed to aggregate repository and journal systems.
More specifically:
- Google Scholar crawls and indexes research papers that can be
  found on the web and links to the original source, while CORE
  harvests and caches the full text.
- Google Scholar limits its access only at the
  [granularity level](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november12/knoth/11knoth.html),
  i.e. its search engine, whereas CORE is in position to extend access
  to raw data and, apart from the CORE search engine.
- Google Scholar offers both closed access and open access resources,
  while CORE offers open access resources only, enabling immediate
  access to full text.
- The audience is different. Even though CORE has a search engine
  where users can retrieve scientific literature, it focuses also
  on other types of research stakeholders, such as text miners and repository
  managers, and offers services designed for them, such as the
  [CORE API](~services/api) and [Dataset](~services/dataset).
