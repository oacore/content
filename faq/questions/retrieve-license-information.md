  How can I retrieve the license information (CC-BY, CC-BY-NC, etc.)
  from the harvested outputs?
category: Removing full text or metadata

An output's license is not consistently exposed by content providers in a
machine readable form. In some circumstances it may be possible to extract
this from the "fulltextUrls" field in the [CORE API](~services/api). However, this is
subject to the license the data offered by the data provider.
