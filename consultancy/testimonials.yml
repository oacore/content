  - content: “We are integrating the CORE API into our product, IRIS, because so far
      it is the open access portal that covers almost all open access content,
      provides easy to integrate API and has a powerful search querying engine.
      We want to make open access articles more easily accessible and more
      useful to researchers and the open public and we see the CORE API as a way
      to speed that up.”

  - content: “The CORE team understand data mining. As an independent company, we
      had no obvious access to big, diverse scholarly data – a killer in our
      drive to develop classification algorithms. The CORE repository, available
      in bulk, was a breakthrough. Now our algorithms outperform even those from
      huge publishers.”
