Additional fields of work in this context included the use of automatic classification, VR-based search environments and, most recently, data monitoring (e.g. ORCID use in publication environments).Software developments in the areas of discovery systems, digitization, search engine technologies and the introduction of cloud-based library management systems also complemented the range of work.
