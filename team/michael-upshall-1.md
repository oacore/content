After several years working with AI companies making use of scholarly corpora, I have the chance to work with a corpus directly! I’m fascinated to learn more from our current and potential users of CORE, whether in institutions or corporate environments. I’ve been involved in scholarly publishing for more years than I care to remember, including writing and presenting, but I like best meeting people at face-to-face events (remember those?) and helping to discover how technology can solve business problems. michael.upshall@open.ac.u
