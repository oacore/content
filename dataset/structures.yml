      The CORE dump implements the approach of the [ResourceSync Framework

      Resource Dump standard](http://www.openarchives.org/rs/1.1/resourcesync#ResourceDump).


      Note that this is an extremely large file (&Tilde;395GB) and appropriate tools are necessary for downloading it. Once extracted it will use about 2.1TB of filesystem.


      1. Perform the extraction by running:

         ```sh
         tar -xf resync_dump.tar.xz -C /target/directory
         ```
      2. The previous steps will extract the big archive in multiple smaller files.
         Each archive contains all the resources for a specific CORE data provider
         the full list which you can find at our [data providers](/data-providers)
         page.

         The following command extracts every single archive in the
         appropriate folder.

         ```sh
         #!/bin/bash

         for FILE in `ls -1 tmp/*.tar.xz`;
         do
                 PROVIDER="${FILE%.*.*}"
                 echo $PROVIDER
                 echo $FILE
                 mkdir -p output/$PROVIDER
         	tar xf $FILE -C output/$PROVIDER/
         done
         ```

         Replace *PROVIDER* with the ID of every single archive.

      The extracted folder generated in step 4, is a two-level deep

      file structure and includes a Manifest named manifest.xml file

      in the root, which lists the resources. Below is the format of

      a single entry in the manifest which lists the available resources:


      ```xml

      <url>
        <loc>https://core.ac.uk/api-v2/articles/get/132196135</loc>
        <rs:md
          hash="md5:39127e4b3b76fc5a66f3eabee28ab71f"
          length="3759"
          type="application/json"
          path="/182/a2/132196135.json"
        />
      </url>

      ```


      The url inside the `<loc></loc>` tags is the ID of the file that can be used

      for tracking future updates on the resource. The path attribute is where the

      file can be found in the folder structure, and in order to validate the file,

      a md5 checksum and the file size are also provided.
