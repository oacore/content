      The CORE dump implements the approach of the [ResourceSync Framework

      Resource Dump standard](http://www.openarchives.org/rs/1.1/resourcesync#ResourceDump).


      Note that this is an extremely large file (&Tilde;395GB) and appropriate tools are necessary for downloading it. Once extracted it will use about 2.1TB of filesystem.


      Perform the extraction by running:


      ```sh

      tar -xf resync_dump.tar.xz -C /target/directory

      ```


      The previous steps will extract the big archive in multiple smaller files.

      Each archive contains all the resources for a specific CORE data provider

      the full list which you can find at our [data providers](/data-providers)

      page.


      The following command extracts every single archive in the

      appropriate folder.


      ```sh

      #!/bin/bash


      for FILE in `ls -1 tmp/*.tar.xz`;

      do
              PROVIDER="${FILE%.*.*}"
              echo $PROVIDER
              echo $FILE
              mkdir -p output/$PROVIDER
      	tar xf $FILE -C output/$PROVIDER/
      done

      ```


      Replace **PROVIDER** with the **ID** of every single archive.


      The extracted folder generated in step 4, is a two-level deep

      file structure and includes a Manifest named **manifest.xml** file

      in the root, which lists the resources. Below is the format of

      a single entry in the manifest which lists the available resources:


      ```xml

      <url>
        <loc>https://core.ac.uk/api-v2/articles/get/132196135</loc>
        <rs:md
          hash="md5:39127e4b3b76fc5a66f3eabee28ab71f"
          length="3759"
          type="application/json"
          path="/182/a2/132196135.json"
        />
      </url>

      ```


      The **url** inside the `<loc></loc>` tags is the **ID** of the file that can be used

      for tracking future updates on the resource. The path attribute is where the

      file can be found in the folder structure, and in order to validate the file,

      a md5 checksum and the file size are also provided.

  - title: Structure of dataset 2018 onwards
    id: dataset2018
    text: >-
      The downloadable tar file contains **XZ** compressed files of **Article
      Metadata**. The **XZ** compressed file is a file named
      `[repositoryID].json.xz`. Once decompressed, each line in the text file
      contains the metadata for **1** article in **JSON**.


      We chose the **xz** format due to a better compression ratio vs bzip2 or gzip. The downside is the tools are not always installed by default.\

      Most Linux distributions have **xz** available for installation in the default package manager. Mac users can install **xz** via **Brew** or **MacPorts** and there are many other free alternatives. Windows users can use **7-zip**. If you have any trouble extracting the files, please contact us.


      Please note that each JSON file is *not* valid JSON however, each line is. Each line is delimited using a Windows formatted newline (\r\n).


      The dump structure has changed to following format:


      ```json

      The CORE dataset provides access to both the enriched metadata as well as
      the full-texts. The data dump consists of two files, the metadata file and
      the content file. Both files are compressed using **tar** and **gzip**.


      An example of a metadata item in the data set is as follows:
