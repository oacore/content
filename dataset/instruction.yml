title: How to download the Dataset
id: instruction
recommended: >-2
   We recommend that you download the files using **CURL** or **WGET**

  * **wget** -c (url of the data dump ending in .tar.gz)

  * **curl** -L -O -C - (url of the data dump ending in .tar.gz)


  For bigger datasets, you might want to consider using dedicated tools such as aria2 <https://aria2.github.io/>.


  For the **CURL** request, notice the hyphen *after* the –C and *before* the .


  If the download is halted, you can resume downloading by re-running the same command.
