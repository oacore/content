title: How to download the latest dataset (2024)
id: latest
recommended: >-2
  We recommend you download the files using **CURL** or **WGET**


  Since we changed the structure of **Dataset 2024**, you don't need to download one big archive; now, you can download smaller parts individually.


  Required credentials to gain access to the list of batches:


    * **https://core.ac.uk/[link]/dataset_index.xml, **

    * **[username]** 
  
    * **[password]** 
  
  The link and credentials will be shared with you via email.

    Example to download one single Dataset archive:


    * **wget** -c https://[user]:[password]@core.ac.uk/[link]/[batch-name].tar.gz

    * **curl** -L -O -C - https://[user]:[password]@core.ac.uk/[link]/[batch-name].tar.gz
    
    
    To download all archives, you can save and parse the **dataset_index.xml** file with links for archives
