  We recommend you download the files using **CURL** or **WGET**


  Since we changed the structure of **Dataset 2024**, you don't need to download one big archive; now, you can download smaller parts individually.


  To check a list of Dataset batches visit **[LINK]**. To get access to this page you need to use a **[username]** and **[password]** should be shared with you in a separate message.
