    CORE collects, harmonises and enriches large quantities of both metadata and full text research articles from thousands of [data providers](/data-providers). On top of this continuously growing corpus, we provide a truly unique API providing real-time machine access to both the metadata and full texts of research papers, enabling developers to build and run innovative applications on top of CORE's content.
