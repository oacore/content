      content: |
        Please [register to receive an API key](/api-keys/register)
        and start testing the [live examples](https://api.core.ac.uk/docs/v3).
        
        A good starting point to start coding with our API is to
        follow the examples gallery available in the [documentation](https://api.core.ac.uk/docs/v3#section/Quick-start-examples).
        In collaboration with [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) you can find
        an [R client for the CORE API](https://github.com/ropensci/rcoreoa) in the GitHub repository.
        All our SDKs are available from [our GitHub organisation](https://github.com/oacore).
    - title: Can I use the CORE API for commercial purposes?
      content: |
        Yes, you can use the CORE API for commercial purposes,
        [(Terms & Conditions)](https://core.ac.uk/terms) apply.
        We provide 30 Day Free Trial for Institution and Enterprise.
        We will ask you for your circumstances during the registration process
        and we might contact you afterwards to clarify any points and assess your eligibility
        for a free licence. If your circumstances change, you need to let us know about it.
    - title: Rate limits
      content: |
        CORE API is free and does not require registration, subject to our [rate limits](https://api.core.ac.uk/docs/v3#section/Rate-limits). However, organisations that register get a faster rate that is typically not free. For [Supporting and Sustaining Members](/membership), the faster rate comes as a free member benefit.
  note: If you use CORE in your work, we kindly request you to cite one of our publications.
