title: CORE's Distinctive Characteristics
description: |
  CORE is an open scholarly infrastructure service aligned with the Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure [(POSI)](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/adopters/). Beyond this shared foundation, CORE is defined by a set of distinctive characteristics that shape how it is built, governed, and operated.

  - title: Scholarly Data Characteristics
    description: |
      The foundational characteristics guiding our data services.
    characteristics:
      - title: 1. Comprehensive metadata coverage for all global scholarly resources
        description: |
          CORE provides a comprehensive bibliographic database of research outputs globally.

          We work directly with thousands of repositories and the number of repositories in CORE is constantly growing. 
          This enables inclusive global coverage across institutions, disciplines, and regions, including content 
          often underrepresented elsewhere.

      - title: 2. The world's largest full text open access corpus
        description: |
          CORE constitutes the world's largest collection of open access scholarly documents.

          This corpus underpins discovery, analysis, and facilitates innovation across the global research ecosystem.

          CORE provides machine-readable full text access via our data services (API, Dataset, FastSync), enabling 
          the text and data mining of research content, AI research, and large-scale analysis.

          While many scholarly infrastructures only provide links to content, making access to this content cumbersome 
          for machines, CORE is a true text mining enabler, positioning CORE as a foundational open scholarly 
          infrastructure for responsible AI development as well as advancing and streamlining research processes.

      - title: 3. Unique collection
        description: |
          CORE's content is not just a copy of data in well-known scholarly infrastructures, such as those registering DOIs. 
          A significant proportion of CORE's content does not have registered DOIs, meaning that we serve unique corpora 
          often not available from scholarly indexing systems, aggregators and bibliographic databases. This includes 
          documents such as theses, research reports, preprints and papers from many, even high-profile academic venues 
          that are not embedded in the DOI system.

          By doing so, CORE helps ensure that valuable research outputs are not excluded from discovery due to 
          infrastructure or publishing constraints.

      - title: 4. Provenance-rich transparent metadata
        description: |
          CORE ensures we always provide metadata with clear provenance information to the source data provider.

          This means that while CORE conducts normalisation and metadata enrichment, it is always possible to understand 
          which data sources have been used. This transparency supports trust, attribution, and responsible reuse of 
          repository data.

      - title: 5. Trustworthy, faithful and authoritative metadata
        description: |
          From our API, it is always possible to access metadata in exactly the way in which it is provided by our 
          data providers.

          This means that we support authoritative, faithful and transparent exposition of metadata in exactly the way 
          supplied by our providers.

          Repositories can therefore rely on CORE as a reliable steward of their authoritative metadata rather than an 
          opaque intermediary they can hardly control. This is a very unique feature of CORE among scholarly infrastructures 
          and bibliographic databases, which typically exercise strict ownership over scholarly metadata with little ability 
          for metadata creators to be able to remain in control and correct issues.

  - title: Community, Sustainability and Governance Characteristics
    description: |
      Our practical approach to governance, community and sustainability.
    characteristics:
      - title: 6. Scholarly community-first
        description: |
          CORE operates under a community funding and governance model.

          We are building CORE from philanthropic and community-aligned support, ensuring decisions are driven by shared 
          values, community stakeholders are able to influence CORE's direction and development.

          This ensures that CORE evolves in response to real community needs rather than commercial incentives.

          Our governance model is designed to represent and protect the interests of repositories and open scholarly 
          infrastructures.

          While even commercial stakeholders are able to use CORE and help to subsidise CORE's operation, our Board of 
          Supporters, our governance body which prioritises CORE's development roadmap, is exclusively reserved for open 
          repositories participation, ensuring alignment of our work with community values and priorities. This governance 
          structure safeguards CORE's mission and ensures accountability to the scholarly community it serves.

      - title: 7. Sustainability-driven not-for-profit model
        description: |
          CORE distributes no dividends to shareholders. All income graciously received is invested in the operation and 
          sustainability of CORE, i.e. to fund staff costs, infrastructure costs, etc.

          Every contribution directly supports the maintenance, improvement, and resilience of CORE's services.

          We have been around for more than 15 years and have a strong record in sustaining our infrastructure long-term, 
          regardless of changing external circumstances. This track record demonstrates CORE's reliability as a global open 
          scholarly infrastructure.

      - title: 8. Distributed funding model
        description: |
          As opposed to some other scholarly infrastructures, we are not dependent on a single large philanthropic donor, 
          ensuring our actions are controlled by the community we serve and not by a single entity.

          We are committed to a distributed funding model, which we believe is key to long-term stability and resilience. 
          This approach reduces dependency risk, strengthens community ownership, and supports continuity even in changing 
          funding environments.

      - title: 9. Scholarly infrastructure built by researchers for researchers
        description: |
          CORE has been conceived by researchers and it continues to be led by researchers ensuring alignment with its 
          original mission and the researchers community.

          Built with a deep understanding of scholarly workflows and needs. This perspective informs CORE's technical 
          design and service development.

      - title: 10. Co-design approach
        description: |
          While others build platforms on top of open research, CORE builds infrastructure with the open research community 
          in mind and gives back to it. Our services are shaped through ongoing collaboration with repositories, researchers, 
          and partners.

      - title: 11. Always giving back - actively supporting the global decentralised scholarly repositories ecosystem
        description: |
          CORE believes that academic institutions need to be strategically enabled to keep track of all scholarly resources 
          authored by their academics. Metadata of these resources should be made openly available by these institutions via 
          their repositories as this is a cornerstone of a FAIR decentralised open repositories ecosystem.

          CORE advocates for the above vision and actively supports its fulfilment by helping data providers to achieve it, 
          including:

          * Increasing awareness of the importance of this vision for the scholarly ecosystem
          * Providing tools, guidance, and feedback to help repositories improve metadata quality and compliance in the form 
            of the CORE Dashboard

          Through this work, CORE acts as an active partner in strengthening repository practice globally.

      - title: 12. Active force for interoperability and FAIRness
        description: |
          CORE actively helps repositories remain interoperable across the global ecosystem. This support includes 
          methodical, technological, and standardisation support.

          We support shared standards and practices so repositories are not locked into closed or proprietary pipelines. 
          This protects institutional autonomy and supports long-term FAIR alignment.

      - title: 13. Driving innovation in open scholarly infrastructures
        description: |
          CORE is a leading voice actively participating in working groups addressing a wide variety of issues concerning 
          open repositories infrastructure.

          We have been supporting standards creation (e.g. metadata schemas, next generation repositories, etc.) and adoption, 
          technology support for open access compliance and driving up discoverability in repositories as well as addressing 
          pressing problems of the open scholarly infrastructures community, such as AI bots. CORE combines infrastructure 
          delivery with thought leadership across the open research landscape.
