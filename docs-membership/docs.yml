      The Dashboard is the central hub from which you can access all membership
      benefits.  


      In the Dashboard you can:


      * control and configure how CORE indexes your data and how it displays information about you as a data provider within the CORE ecosystem,

      * set up your repository so that our OAI Resolver can resolve your OAI identifiers directly to your repository,

      * validate that your repository metadata conforms to best practices and standards,

      * manage how metadata from your repository is exposed across the open access research network,

      * monitor and access statistics, such as on downloads, enrichments and OA compliance,

      * install repository plugins, such as the CORE Recommender and Discovery.

       **Access to Dashboard account:** It is possible to have multiple Dashboard accounts for one organisation. You can send an invitation to your colleagues from the **Settings tab**.

      CORE Discovery helps users to discover freely accessible copies of
      research papers. It is available as a  plugin. This plugin enriches a
      metadata record in your repository with a full text link of the described
      article, whenever an open access version of the document is available
      anywhere across the open research network.


      You can install the CORE Discovery plugin directly from the Dashboard by clicking on the **Plugins tab** on the sidebar.


      More information about how this works can be found on the [CORE Discovery page](https://core.ac.uk/services/discovery).

      An OAI (Open Archives Initiative) identifier is a unique identifier of a
      metadata record. OAI identifiers are used in the context of repositories
      using the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting
      (OAI-PMH). 


      CORE can resolve any OAI identifier to either a metadata page of the record in CORE or route it directly to your repository page. To route directly to the repository, it is necessary to provide mapping in the CORE Repository page between the OAI prefix of a repository and the currently used URL for the repository metadata record display page/splash. The redirection will change instantly.


      To register your OAI mapping you should go to the **Settings tab** in the Dashboard. More information about OAI identifiers, why they are important and how you can enable OAI resolving to your repository can be found on the OAI Resolver [documentation](https://core.ac.uk/documentation/oai-resolver) page.

      * Harmonised access to data across CORE’s data providers network,

      * Detailed [API documentation](https://api.core.ac.uk/docs/v3) with live examples and wrappers to common programming languages.


      Many of our API users are researchers, masters and PhD students in all domains who need to programmatically and systematically interrogate a large research corpus. The API is often used  in the context of national and international research projects. Increasingly, it is also being used to provide research analytics for academic institutions.

      Many of our Dataset users are researchers, masters and PhD students in all domains who need to  programmatically and systematically interrogate 

      a large research corpus within their own infrastructure. The Dataset is often used to train machine learning models for a wide range of activities 

      in the context of national and international research projects. 


      The Dataset provides you with:


      * The entire CORE corpus of both metadata and full texts in a machine readable format,

      * Detailed [documentation](https://api.core.ac.uk/docs/v3) on how to download the CORE dataset and how data is organised.


      The membership provides you with a licence to use the [CORE Dataset](https://core.ac.uk/documentation/dataset#latest) within your organisation, except for  commercial purposes, subject to our [T&Cs](https://core.ac.uk/terms).


      Detailed information about how to use the CORE Dataset can be found in the [Dataset documentation](https://core.ac.uk/documentation/dataset).
