      The Dashboard is the central hub from which you can access all membership benefits.  
      
      In the Dashboard you can:
      
      * control and configure how CORE indexes your data and how it displays information about you as a data provider within the CORE ecosystem,
      * set up your repository so that our OAI Resolver can resolve your OAI identifiers directly to your repository,
      * validate that your repository metadata conforms to best practices and standards,
      * manage how metadata from your repository is exposed across the open access research network,
      * monitor and access statistics, such as on downloads, enrichments and OA compliance.
      * install repository plugins, such as the CORE Recommender and Discovery.
      
       **Access to Dashboard account:** It is possible to have multiple Dashboard accounts for one organisation. You can send an invitation to your colleagues from the <dynamic href="settings">Settings</dynamic> tab.

      CORE Discovery helps users to discover freely accessible copies of research papers. It is available as a  plugin. This plugin enriches a metadata record in your repository with a full text link of the described article, whenever an open access version of the document is available anywhere across the open research network.
      
      You can install the CORE Discovery plugin directly from the Dashboard by clicking on the <dynamic href="Plugins">Plugins</dynamic> tab on the sidebar.
      
      More information about how this works can be found on the [CORE Discovery page](https://core.ac.uk/services/discovery).

      Increases the discoverability of your content via:
      
      * **PMC LinkOut** - open access full texts from your repository promoted to PubMed Central via their  [LinkOut](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/linkout/) service. 
      * **Recommended across the repositories network** - your organisation's research becomes discoverable from within hundreds of repositories who use the CORE Recommender plugin, including high-profile repositories such as arxiv.org. 
      
      The Discovery Boost is automatically applied to your organisation’s content when you become a CORE Member.

      An OAI (Open Archives Initiative) identifier is a unique identifier of a metadata record. OAI identifiers are used in the context of repositories using the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). 
      
      CORE can resolve any OAI identifier to either a metadata page of the record in CORE or route it directly to your repository page. To route directly to the repository, it is necessary to provide mapping in the CORE Repository page between the OAI prefix of a repository and the currently used URL for the repository metadata record display page/splash. The redirection will change instantly.
      
      To register your OAI mapping you should go to the <dynamic href="settings">Settings</dynamic> tab in the Dashboard. More information about OAI identifiers, why they are important and how you can enable OAI resolving to your repository can be found on the OAI Resolver [documentation](https://core.ac.uk/documentation/oai-resolver) page.

      Tools for Open Access compliance monitoring. Currently we support the monitoring of the time lag between 
      the deposit of a paper into a repository and its publication date. These features are continuously  being  
      developed to accommodate changes in recent OA policies. Particularly, we are working hard to provide tools to support 
      the monitoring of Plan S and UKRI OA policies. If you are interested in us monitoring a policy that we do not currently support, 
      please [contact us](https://core.ac.uk/about#contact) and we will consider adding support for it.
