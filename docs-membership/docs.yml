      An OAI (Open Archives Initiative) identifier is a unique identifier of a
      metadata record. OAI identifiers are used in the context of repositories
      using the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Indexing
      (OAI-PMH). 


      CORE can resolve any OAI identifier to either a metadata page of the record in CORE or route it directly to your repository page. To route directly to the repository, it is necessary to provide mapping in the CORE Repository page between the OAI prefix of a repository and the currently used URL for the repository metadata record display page/splash. The redirection will change instantly.


      To register your OAI mapping you should go to the [Settings tab](https://dashboard.core.ac.uk/data-providers/{{id}}/settings) in the Dashboard. More information about OAI identifiers, why they are important and how you can enable OAI resolving to your repository can be found on the OAI Resolver [documentation](https://core.ac.uk/documentation/oai-resolver) page.

      “Request  Reindexing” is a feature for repository managers. This function
      is available from the CORE dashboard, [Indexing status
      tab](https://dashboard.core.ac.uk/data-providers{{id}}/indexing). CORE
      performs indexing periodically. The frequency depends on a range of
      criteria, including how often you make changes to your repository, and the
      repository size. But by clicking on this button, you can send a request to
      have your repository reindexed;  you can jump the queue.


      When might you want to apply for reindexing? 

      * Your repository has been indexed more than two months ago.

      * You have made some updates to your metadata, and you would like the changes to appear on CORE.

      * You have fixed some other issues in your repository. 


      When you request a reindex, you should state why you want your content to be reindexed. After you have clicked on the “request reindexing” button, you will see three different messages, based on  where CORE is with the indexing cycle:

      * **Scheduled:** Your request for reindexing has been submitted. Our team will review the request and submit your repository for reindexing. After this status will change to “In progress”. 

      * **In progress:** Your repository is now being indexed. This process can take 1-2 weeks (depending on the size and complexity of your repository). After indexing has finished, the status will change to Completed.

      * **Completed:** Reindexing of your repository is finished.


      When you request a reindex, you will see a confirmation message, confirming that your repository is now being indexed. It sometimes happens that the reindexing halts without completion, before the process is complete. If your reindexing has been in progress for longer than two weeks, you can send us a message to investigate via this form. 


      Note: if you change your OAI-PMH indexing address, for example when you change the software used for your repository platform, CORE will automatically reindex your content – you don’t have to request a reindex.

    descriptionAbout: >
      Our technology searches your repository to identify different versions of
      your articles and potential duplicates within your repository. This can
      help you in managing and curating your repository content. We periodically
      detect near-duplicate records and versions and allow you to compare them
      side by side. This can help you improve your repository metadata and keep
      the repository clean. When investigating the detected matches, you can
      mark them either as duplicates, different version or not the same article.
      This advises CORE how to index them. Please note that it is not possible
      to delete or merge duplicates in your repository directly from this
      dashboard. However, you can use this tool to identify these potential
      issues and then resolve them in a way that is supported by your specific
      repository platform. Matches can be downloaded in a .csv format.

      The list of possible duplicates in your repository  contains the potential duplicates which CORE identified. You can compare them to this record and review how they differ. You can subsequently mark them as “to be removed” or “different from the reference paper”. 

      * **“To be removed”:** this indicates that one of the other presented records in the repository are the same as this record. You decided to mark this record as the one to be removed.

      * **“Different from the reference paper”:** this indicates that this record is not related to the reference paper. You decided to disassociate this record from the reference paper. This will remove the connection of this record from the reference Works entity.

      When you mark a paper as “to be removed” or “different from the reference paper”, then this marking will be exporter in a .csv format when you download the data using the download button.

      When you mark a paper as different from the reference paper, then this will impact how CORE displays this article in Search, API and other services. Specifically, this article will be disassociated from the reference Work entity.

      Rights Retention Strategy (RRS) enables authors to exercise the authorship
      rights they have on their manuscripts to deposit a copy of the Author
      Accepted Manuscript (AAM) in a repository on publication and provide open
      access to it. RRS is typically implemented by means of authors inserting a
      rights retention statement in their manuscript. CORE provides
      functionality to automatically identify papers with these Rights Retention
      Strategy statements, by means of testing if the rights retention statement
      is present in the paper’s full text.


      There are three  sections in the RRS strategy tab in the CORE Dashboard:

      * **Outputs with RRS statements:** This will display all papers that have been identified to contain an RRS statement within your repository collection.

      * **RRS checker:** This a tool that allows to check if there are RRS statements in a manuscript you upload. PDF and DOC formats are supported.

      * **RRS statements to review:** This indicates the number of papers in your repository which we recommend you to review. By clicking on the Review RRS button you will find the specific RRS sentence CORE identified within the manuscript.  You have the possibility to mark it as “Correct” or “Wrong”.


      We recommend that you regularly review the automatically extracted RRS statements to confirm they are correct. You will then be able to download a .csv file which contains these reviewed RRS statements, for instance, for the purposes of importing this information into your repository. The RRS identification runs on your full texts, CORE cannot detect RRS statements from papers CORE doesn’t have access to.

      CORE complies with the conditions of the licence where the licence
      information is exposed. Review the [Data Provider’s
      Guide](https://core.ac.uk/documentation/data-providers-guide#licence-information)
      to understand how to expose your licence information to CORE. For content
      without an explicit licence statement you can set up full text licence
      configuration in your CORE Dashboard account:   


      Setting > Repository > Licencing


      Two configuration options are available:


      **Indexed and hosted (recommended)**: CORE will index both metadata and full text content in your repository. CORE will be able to:

      * Increase the discoverability of your content in CORE Search, [Discovery](https://core.ac.uk/services/discovery) and [Recommender](https://core.ac.uk/services/recommender) and promote links to your content to our open scholarly infrastructure partners, such as PubMed Central via the [LinkOut](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/linkout/) cooperation, providing maximum visibility for your content on the Web and resulting in more exposure for your researchers.

      * Process your content to check for near-duplicates in your and other repositories.

      * Provide full support for the machine readability of your content in the CORE API and Dataset.


      **Indexed only**: CORE will index metadata and full text, but some functionalities will be affected:

      * CORE Search ranks articles that are full Open Access (in accordance with BOAI) first, which means the discoverability of your content will be limited.

      * CORE Recommender only recommends to users full Open Access articles, which means that papers without explicit OA licences from your repository will not appear as recommendations.

      * CORE duplicate checker will be less accurate.

      * The CORE Discovery will not recommend this content from your repository without an explicit OA licence.

      * The ability of CORE to enable machine readability of your content will be affected. Machine readability of research manuscripts might be mandated by the government or a funder in your country. Note that some countries operate text and data mining exceptions for research purposes, so only non-research use will be affected.


      To change this configuration you need to chose one of the options from the drop-down list as shown on the screenshot below.


      **Please note**: that changing licencing configuration from “Indexed and hosted” to “Indexed only”  and vice versa requires full reindexing.  We anticiate it might take up to a week.
