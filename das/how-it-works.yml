    A Data Availability Statement is essential for ensuring research transparency and reproducibility. It specifies whether the data supporting a study is available, where it can be accessed, and under what conditions. Including a DAS in a research paper helps to:
    * enhance transparency – clearly stating how and where research data can be accessed,
    
    * supports reproducibility – enables other researchers to validate and build upon this work,
    
    * improves compliance –meets the requirements of journals, funders, and Open Science initiatives,
    
    * increases research impact – properly documented datasets attract more citations and collaborations.
